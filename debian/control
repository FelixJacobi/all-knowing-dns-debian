Description: tiny DNS server for IPv6 Reverse DNS
 AllKnowingDNS provides reverse DNS for IPv6 networks which use SLAAC
 (autoconf), e.g. for a /64 network.
 .
 The problem with IPv6 reverse DNS and traditional nameservers is that the
 nameserver requires you to provide a zone file. Assuming you want to provide
 RDNS for a /64 network, you have 2**64 = 18446744073709551616 different usable
 IP addresses (a little less if you are using SLAAC). Providing a zone file for
 that, even in a very terse notation, would consume a huge amount of disk space
 and could not possibly be held in the memory of the computers available
 nowadays.
 .
 AllKnowingDNS instead generates PTR and AAAA records on the fly. You only
 configure which network you want to serve and what your entries should look
 like.
