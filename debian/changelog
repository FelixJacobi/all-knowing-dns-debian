all-knowing-dns (1.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO:
  - d/rules: the override_dh_install is not very pretty, the typical way to
    install the file would be to create a debian/all-knowing-dns.install file
    (handled by dh_install)
  - d/copyright: please remove the POD formatting fragments ('C<<' and '>>')
  - d/copyright: copyright years for M::I seem to end in 2011, not 2012
    (not the newest version of M::I that the copyright.html page refers to)
  - d/all-knowing-dns.init: trying to source the not-existing default file
    seems unnecessary
  - does installing all-knowing-dns.conf to /etc make sense? this
    RaumZeitLabor looks very specific. maybe as an example?

  * Initial Release (Closes: #663508).
